# CountMyLaps-Website1

This is a website for the app "Count My Laps"

v0.1 Pre-release:

The initial design for the webpage is complete! The register.html page is currently being worked on as it only displays a topbar but I will implememt stuff later on.

It's best to stay away from the register.html file. It doesn't do anything

Right now, nothing really works. Just the design of the index.html page is about done.
